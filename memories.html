            style="color:#d67cba;">I loved going to the eras tour with my mom and aunts in Amsterdam! It was such an amzing experience. So was getting our dog Harper who's a crazy bean and it was so special to have a photoshoot with her. She's such a diva! Another favourite memory was going on a private backstage theatre tour of MOULIN ROUGE and Stranger Things with my uncle, that was so much fun, it was awesome.
